#### 1. (2 points) 
Consider our paper airplane experiment as a pilot study. Now list sources of variation (from class-to-class, or EU-to-EU) that could impact differences in recorded distances. For full credit, include at least 4 sources of variation.

#### 2. (2 points) 
Based on your expertise as a paper airplane maker / thrower. What do you think would be a meaningful difference in distance between two types of paper airplanes? Why?

#### 3. (2 points) 
Given the dataset from Lab 4 (and visualization) along with your answer the Q2. Do you think you have sufficient sample size to detect the meaningful difference you specified in Q2? Why or why not.

#### 4. (1 points)
Give what you know now, how would you propose analyzing the data from the airplane experiment?
