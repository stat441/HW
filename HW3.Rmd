#### 1. (2 points) 

Was our treatment assignment for the paper airplane example a CRD? Why or why not?

#### 2. (2 points) 

Given what you now know, do you think our randomization procedure for the paper airplane experiment was reasonable? Why or why not?

#### 3. (4 points) 

Consider the paper airplane experiment where there are 40 EUs (corresponding to two throws for 20 participants). Using a CRD assign treatments (1 = dart and 2 = glider) to all 40 EUs. 

```{r}
airplane <- tibble(EU = 1:40, person = rep(1:20, each = 2), throw = rep(1:2, 20));
airplane
```
